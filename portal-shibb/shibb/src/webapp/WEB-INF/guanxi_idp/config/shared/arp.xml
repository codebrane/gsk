<!-- arp.xml
     This is the root ARP file for the Guanxi IdP. Although you can put all bags and providers in this file
     it's easier to manage your release policies if you group logical attribute relationships in separate
     bag files and define all your service providers in another file. -->
<arp xmlns="urn:guanxi:idp">
  <!-- This file contains all the service providers that the IdP recognises. You can include
       as many files as you want, even putting each service provider in it's own file. If a
       service provider is not listed in any of the files then attributes will not be
       released to it. -->

  <!-- This file contains all the bags of attributes that are available to be released by the IdP.
       Different Attributors will generated different sets of attributes. As well as that, the
       mapping rules can generate new attributes from those originals generated by the Attributors.
       All attributes, both generated and mapped should be listed in bag files before they can be
       referenced from a provider entry. If they are not then they will not be released. -->
