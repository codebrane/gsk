LDAP authentication and why you may need a privileged user
==========================================================
If your LDAP system is locked down such that anonymous searching is not allowed, which is a good idea, you will have to
specify the full DN of a user that has enough privileges to logon to your LDAP system and search for other users. The
reason for this is LDAP authentication works with a user's DN, not their CN (search-attribute). As you don't expect the
user to have to know, let alone remember their DN, it must be constructed when they login using their normal login ID:

	> User logs in to system as "jbloggs"
	> Authenticator builds search string as : <search-attribute>"=jbloggs", e.g. "cn=jbloggs"
	> Authenticator binds to the LDAP store as the privileged user and searches for the user who has "cn=jbloggs"
	> Authenticator gets the DN for "cn=jbloggs" if the user is found
	> Authenticator then binds to the LDAP store using the DN just found, e.g. "cn=jbloggs,ou=staff,ou=org,o=uni"
