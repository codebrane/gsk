  <!-- This is portal bridging class that handles logout after a GSK login.
       This class is called by Spring after each bean is loaded and
       initialised, allowing us to return an AOP proxy in place of a
       particular bean.
       In this class, we define a point cut for the main portal logout
       functionality and define an advice for that point cut that
       propagates the logout event to the GSK portal.
       The advice is implemented by:
       org.guanxi.sp.sakai.pod.impl.aop.GuanxiAOPInterceptor -->
  <bean class="org.guanxi.sp.sakai.pod.impl.aop.GuanxiAOPProxy" />
