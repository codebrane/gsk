Introduction
============
The Guanxi Shibb Kit (GSK) is a one-stop Shibboleth shop for Sakai. The kit installs a new portal:
/portal-shibb
which contains a Shibboleth Identity Provider, Service Provider and WAYF. The kit is built using
the Guanxi Shibboleth implementation, which is a pure Java Shibboleth system.
You can use the kit to turn Sakai into either a Shibboleth Identity Provider (IdP) or a 
Shibboleth Service provider (SP).

Installation
============
Please refer to the main GSK site for building and installation instructions:
